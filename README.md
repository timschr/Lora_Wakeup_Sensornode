## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Wake-up Receivers (WuRs)! 

Have you ever wished to have a tiny, ultra-low power device that can awaken your sensor nodes from sleep mode only when needed, saving power and reducing latency? WuR is the game-changer you've been waiting for!

This technology can be the brain of your next IoT project, enabling wireless sensor networks to function efficiently, conserve energy, and respond swiftly. From setting up a smart home system that wakes up when you're near, to implementing precision agriculture that responds to real-time changes in the environment, WuR opens up a world of possibilities.

With our open-source WuR project, you don't just get to learn about this fascinating technology, you get to tinker with it! So dive in, explore the potential, and let's wake up the future of IoT together!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

(Here, mention the software/hardware requirements and how to install them)

### Installation

(Here, give a step-by-step guide to get a development environment running)

## Documentation

The design and testing documentation can be found in the /docs folder. The documentation includes the following:

1. Design architecture
2. Testing methodologies
3. Comparison of different WuR implementations
4. Future work & potential improvements

## Usage

(Here, provide examples of how to use the system. You can provide code snippets or screenshots)

## FAQ

(Questions with their answers go here. For example:)
Q: What is a Wake-Up Receiver?
A: A Wake-Up Receiver (WuR) is a low-power communication system that remains in a low-power standby mode until it receives a specific wireless signal to "wake up" and receive data.
